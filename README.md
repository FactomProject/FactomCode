Factom
===========

Factom provides a way to build applications on the Bitcon blockchain. 

Factom began by providing proof of existence services, but then move on to provide proof of existence of transforms.  A list of such entries can be thought of as a Factom Chain.  Factom can be used to implement private tokens, smart contracts, smart properties, and more.

Factom leverages the Bitcoin Blockchain, but in a way that minimizes the amount of data actually inserted in the Blockchain.  Thus it provides a mechanism for creating Bitcoin 2.0 services for the trading of assets, securities, commondities, or other complex applications without increasing blockchain "pollution".
